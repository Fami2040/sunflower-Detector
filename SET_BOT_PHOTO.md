## 📸 Image Requirements:

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: Square image works best (e.g., 512x512, 640x640)
- **File size**: Under 10MB
- **Content**: Your sunflower image

## 🎨 Tips:

- Use a square crop of your sunflower image
- Center the sunflower in the frame
- Make sure it's clear and recognizable at small sizes
- The image will be displayed as a circle in Telegram

## 🔄 Alternative: Programmatic Method

If you want to automate this (more complex):

1. Create a Telegram channel
2. Add your bot as admin
3. Use the Telegram Bot API `setChatPhoto` method
4. Note: This sets channel photo, not directly bot photo

**But BotFather method is recommended!** It's the official, easiest way.
